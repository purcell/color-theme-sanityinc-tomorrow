An Emacs version of
[Chris Kempson's "Tomorrow" themes](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme),
with much more extensive face definitions than the "official" Emacs
variant.

The themes work with both the built-in theming support in recent
Emacsen, *and* via the traditional `color-theme.el` add-on library in
older versions, so use whichever you prefer.

## Installation ##

If you're all set up to use [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org) or
[MELPA](http://melpa.org/) (highly recommended!), simply

    M-x package-install RET color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow RET

If you use [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/), simply add
this to your packages list:

    color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow

Otherwise, ensure a directory containing these files is on your `load-path`.

If you're using an Emacs version older than 23.x, you'll also need to
install `color-theme.el`.

## Usage ##

    (require 'color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow)

    M-x sanityinc-tomorrow-day
    M-x sanityinc-tomorrow-night
    M-x sanityinc-tomorrow-blue
    M-x sanityinc-tomorrow-bright
    M-x sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties

In newer Emacs versions, just require the library as above, then

    M-x customize-themes
